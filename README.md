Library Management

We have 5 operations in our project that assist the librarian in efficiently managing the library.

## Let's begin by explaining the seven operations.

####  1 -- > Add New Book 

  Creating a New Book:

Before creating a new book, we need to collect data such as:

Title: Represents the name of the book.

Author: Represents the person who wrote the book.

Department: Represents the category under which the book falls.

Rack No: Represents the area where the book is located.

After collecting these details, a new Book object named newBook is created and added to the library. This object represents the new book that you’re adding to the library.
